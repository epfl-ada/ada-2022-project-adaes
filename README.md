# How Predictable Are Humans? 

## Abstract 
The idea behind this study takes its roots in an observation of the behaviour of Wikispeedia's players. After carefully studying some rounds of this game, we observed that most players would rely on the same strategy. At first, players tend to go towards articles that give them the most options for the next hop. Once they feel closer to the target, they go into more specific topics that are closely related to the goal. 

In light of this, we articulate our story around three main chapters : 
1. Can this behaviour be generalised? 
2. What is the semantic meaning of these paths? 
3. Is this strategy optimal? 

We believe that, by analysing the three aforementioned axis, we will be able to provide a relevant insightful analysis of the observed behaviour. 

## Research Questions
Through the different steps of our proposed analysis, we plan on investigating the following questions :  
1. Can this behaviour be generalised? 
      - Are the nodes with the highest out-degree the most visited ones? 
      - What is the evolution of the out-degree of the nodes visited in the path? 

2. What is the semantic meaning of these paths? 
     - What are the topics visited through the path? 
     - Are there recurring topics that this strategy favours? 

3. Is this strategy optimal? 
     - Is this strategy the one that yields the most winner paths? 
     - Or is taking more risks better?
